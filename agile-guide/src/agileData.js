                content: `
                    <p>Agile shifts the focus from rigid planning to continuous adaptation and delivery. This flexibility provides major benefits, especially in dynamic markets:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Faster Time-to-Market:</strong> Delivering working increments frequently (e.g., every 2-4 weeks) rather than waiting months for a single release.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increased Customer Satisfaction:</strong> Continuously incorporating customer feedback ensures the final product meets user needs effectively.</li>
                        <li><strong>Better Risk Management:</strong> Small, iterative releases allow teams to fail fast, reducing the overall cost of change and identifying problems early.</li>
                        <li><strong>Improved Team Morale:</strong> Empowered, self-managing teams who control their own work pace and methods tend to be more motivated and productive.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Continuous visualization of work (Kanban boards, burndown charts) makes progress and impediments visible to everyone, fostering trust.</li>
                    </ul>
